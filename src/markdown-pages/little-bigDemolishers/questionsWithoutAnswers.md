There are questions that become rhetorical. So I went to Google to find out equally rhetorical answers. These are the things that interest me:

1. Where does my poop go from the tray;
2. Where does the food on my plate come from;
3. Why does my slave call me now Kuzey, now Oksana, now Xavier, now Vasya (I am the Queen !!!);
4. Why do people not want them to be warm when I mold my wool on their clothes;
5. Who are all these people;
6. Why people do not allow me to google;

But it is in vain!
