Dear diary, We are writing you because our life is full of the interesting things. We hope, that you will understand us...

We are the three cats, and together we form a Catuda triangle, where all the food disappears.

My name is Ferzis. The name means Queen in chess. I am walking where I want. I look like Maine Coon, but it only looks like.

My name is Shusha. I am such a beautiful cat that I have to hide behind sofas so as not to dazzle people with my beauty. That's why I'm also called the Imaginary Cat... and the Haystack.

I am Samael - the demon cat. I seduced people into taking me home after they said 'No!'.
